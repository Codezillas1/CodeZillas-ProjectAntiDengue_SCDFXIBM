# CodeZillas-ProjectAntiDengue_SCDFXIBM
Using IoT and mobile applications through IBM Cloud to fight dengue

CodeZillas is a team consisting of Verlyn, Hongyu, Jannah, Cleven and Joshua 

We are tackling Problem Statement 4: Preventing the Spread. Our solution, Project Anti-Dengue, aims to reduce the manpower-intensive nature of patrolling by officers. While COVID-19 SARS-CoV2 virus dominates the news nowadays, thereâ€™s another virus that continues to spread in our communities - dengue. Current preventive measures are often manpower-intensive. Moreover, during a global health crisis like the current one, it becomes more difficult for officers to carry out patrolling duties.
